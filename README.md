# Diving
This program will allow users to input a float number as one score for a diver, then will allow the user to input an array of float numbers based on how many units there are and remove the lowest and highest number.
Then it will have the user input a degree of difficulty and display it back to the user.
The code will add up the array, multiply by the difficulty, then multiplied by 0.6 to get the score.

TODO

Have code to remove the highest and lowest number in the array
add up the array, multiply it and display outcome.
